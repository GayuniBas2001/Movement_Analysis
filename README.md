# Movement Analysis System

A real-time computer vision system for exercise form evaluation and repetition counting using MediaPipe pose detection and Intel RealSense depth cameras.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system provides real-time feedback on exercise form, automatically counts repetitions, and offers comprehensive movement analysis using both 2D and 3D pose estimation techniques. It's specifically designed for bicep curl analysis but can be extended to other exercises.
